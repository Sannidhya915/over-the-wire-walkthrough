Need to find a file with the following properties:
human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable

I'll use the  following command:

find . -type f -readable -size 1033c ! -executable -print


-type f = restricts to finding regular files only
-readable = search only files with read permissions
-size 1033c = finds file of 1033byte size
! - executable = excludes executables

You get the following result:
./maybehere07/.file2

Read using:
cat ./maybehere07/.file2

NOTE : There are other files similarly named in the same directory ie. -file2 , spaces file2. Don't let them confuse you.

The contents of file:
