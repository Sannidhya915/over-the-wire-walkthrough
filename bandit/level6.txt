Need to find the filw with following properties:
owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size

Used the following cmd:

find / -group bandit6 -type f -user bandit7 -size 33c

-group = specify group the file belongs to.
-user =  secify user the file belongs to.
-size = specify file size.
-type f = search for regular file.

It's better to filter the results using grep cmd. But i found the file location without it. (not too long list ðŸ˜…)

/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

Read the above file using cat cmd:
